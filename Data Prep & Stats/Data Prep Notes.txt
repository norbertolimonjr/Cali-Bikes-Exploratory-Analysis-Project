Changes in Excel (hhpub Pipeline): [Data Preparation 1/3]
Sequence: 
	Raw -> Compressed -> Clean -> Export

Raw Data -> Compressed Data:
- In this step we reduced our scope of focus
	to hone in on a few related variables sets
- The variable sets were color coded for distinction

Compressed Data -> Clean Data:
- In this step we converted the numerical data to its 
	corresponding string representations in order 
	to improve legability. This was useful for 
	interpreting and extracting meaning from 
	the data at later stages.
- Improved the legibility of the column labels
- Properly spaced out the columns for clarity

Clean Data -> Export Data
- Column label updates was backpropogated on a copy of
	the'Compressed' Data Set to create the last
	worksheet, Export Data
- Extra columns are removed from Clean + Export.
- Variations of null values were identified and thier 
	corresponding rows removed from Clean + Export
- Export Data was then imported into jupyter notebooks
	for the final data prep.

Python Jupyter Notebook: [Data Prep 2/3]
Sequence:
	Import w/ Pandas -> Split by Urban/Rural -> Sampling & Rebalance -> Export to 'samples.xlsx'

Data Prep Output: [Data Prep 3/3]
Sequence: 
	Verify Output from Jupyter Notebook -> Combine Rural & Urban Samples in a third 'Stacked' Sheet 
	-> Saved file as 'Data Prep Output'

Output: [Intro to Data Analysis]
Calculated Correlation between Vehicle Availability Variables ->
	Summary Statistics for Internet Use -> Single Factor ANOVA for the types of transportation for
	Both Rural & Urban Data Samples as well as the combined samples.
